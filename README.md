# AutoML-Powered Adaptive Drift Detection for COVID-19 Forecasting
 This project implements an AutoML-driven adaptive drift detection framework for COVID-19 forecasting, leveraging ADWIN & DDM to dynamically adjust models in response to concept drift. It enhances predictive accuracy by intelligently retraining models, ensuring robust time-series forecasting under evolving data conditions.
